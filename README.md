# Library-API

The Library API is a RESTful web app hosted on Google App Engine with Datastore and Auth0 capabilities and is designed for different libraries to log in, view, and edit their collection catalogs.

API Documentation can be found in 'skinneem_project.pdf'.

A Postman test suite is also provided to demonstrate the API's full functionality.
